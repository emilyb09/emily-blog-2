title: My first day of blogging
---

I have never had a blog before, so we're going to see how it goes. Today, I have been super bored under quarentine(is that how you spell it?). I have recently been 
into the series Divergent by Veronica Roth. It is about a young girl named Beatrice. She lives in a world of factions. There are 5 factions. Erudite(the smart), 
Abnegation(the selfless), Amity(the peaceful), candor(the honest), and Dauntless(the, well, dauntless) it is a wonderful book about a girl trying to find herself 
in the midst of a very old war. I have also been into princeless which is about a princess named Adrienne of whom hates being a princess and wants to save all her 
sisters and be a knight. If you are sensing a pattern, that is because I am a tween at the ripe old age of 12. well, 12 in may. But hey, I'm nearly there! This is a
huge year for me, because I am getting my ears pierced, finally, because nothing says "teenager" like putting more holes in your ears. Also it is, as I have 
mentioned, quarentine. That in of itself is a huge test. I like to belive that I am a demigod or something like all my favorites. Percy Jackson, Aru Shah, Belet Last
Name Unknown, Rue, and a dozen more. If you are looking for a nice quick can't-put-down read these books are the ones for you. If you haven't noticed, I am a 
humongus bookworm. My Mom once said that one guy at her work had two vertical bookselves and another person was like, "wow, you have so many books!" If you have 
seen our house, you would know that it is not that impressive to have only two. Well, I think that concludes my first blog post! bye! To no one in particular.
